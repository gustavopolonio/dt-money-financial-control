# :book: About this Project

Dt money is a financial controller for you put your incomes, outcomes and see your total balance. It was built with [React](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/) and the 
[MirageJS API mocking library](https://miragejs.com/) simulates an backend service.

The project is part of my personal portfolio, so I would appreciate if you provide me any feedback about the ideia, code, structure or anything you could report 
to make me a better developer.

Feel free to use the Dt money as you wish, either to study or make improvementes!
